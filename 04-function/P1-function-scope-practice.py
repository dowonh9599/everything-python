# Question 1: Greeting Function
# Write a function named greet that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting message to the console.
# For example, greet("Alice") should print "Hello, Alice!"

# Question 2: Absolute Value
# Create a function named my_abs that takes a number and returns its absolute value without using the abs() built-in function.
# For instance, my_abs(-5) should return 5, and my_abs(3) should return 3.

# Question 3: Area of a Circle
# Define a function named circle_area that computes the area of a circle. The function should take the radius of the circle as an argument and return the area.
# Use the formula: area = π * r² (you can use 3.14159 as an approximation for π).

# Question 4: Maximum of Two Numbers
# Write a function named max_of_two that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the larger of the two. For example, max_of_two(4, 7) should return 7.

# Question 5: Sum of a List
# Create a function called sum_list that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all elements in the list.
# For instance, sum_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10.

# Question 6: Count Vowels
# Define a function named count_vowels that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in that string.
# Consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' as vowels for this exercise.

# Question 7: Factorial
# Write a function named factorial that computes the factorial of a given number.
# The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, factorial(5) should return 120.

# Question 8: Fibonacci Sequence
# Create a function named fibonacci that takes a number n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
# Recall that the sequence starts with 0, 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

# Question 9: Palindrome Checker
# Define a function named is_palindrome that checks whether a given string is a palindrome
# (reads the same forward and backward). For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True, while is_palindrome("python") should return False.

# Question 10: Temperature Converter
# Write a function named convert_to_celsius that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
# The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is (F - 32) * 5/9. For example, convert_to_celsius(95) should return 35.
