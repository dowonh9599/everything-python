# 4.2 Scope

## 4.2.1 What is Scope?

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Scope we know in real world</p></figcaption></figure>

In Python, Scope refers to the region of a program where a variable is both defined and accessible.

```python
# writing code here means sniper is not looking at the scope
x = "global"

def foo1():
    # writing code here means sniper is looking at everywhere in foo1 region
    x = "foo1 local"
    
    def foo2():
        # writing code here means sniper is looking at everywhere in foo2 region
        x = "foo2 local"
        print(x)  # This will print 'foo2 local' because it's the nearest scope
    
    foo2()
    print(x)  # This will print 'foo1 local'

print(x)  # This prints 'global' because it's in the global scope
```

## 4.2.2 Passing values Across Different Scopes

```python
x = 5
y = 7
z = 9
def add_three_num(x, y, z):
  x = 3
  y = 2
  z = 1
  return x + y + z

print(add_three_num(x, y, z)) # This will result in 6
```

* x, y, z are initialized as 5, 7, and 9 respectively at global region of program
* `However`, in the local region in `add_three_num` function, x, y, and z are 3, 2, and 1 respectively.
* Therefore regardless of what the global variable x, y, z are, `add_three_num` function will return 6 no matter what.

Then how can we pass 5, 7 and 9 to x, y, z in `add_three_num` scope?

```python
x = 5
y = 7
z = 9
def add_three_num(x, y, z):
  # x, y, and z are not reinitialized here. Therefore the value of x, y, and z
  # depends on the values passed through arguments
  return x + y + z

print(add_three_num(x, y, z)) # This will result in 21
```

Arguments of `add_three_num` function plays the role of bridging between global scope and local scope of `add_three_num` function. We can pass values through `x`, `y`, and `z` to use the values that we initialized these variables with (i.e. 5, 7, and 9)



## 4.2.3 Ideal Program Design

* `Minimize` using global variables unless it is a fundamental configuration used across all scopes.
  * **Better Memory Management:** values assigned to local variables takes up the memory only while the program is executing codes in that particular scope only. Once the program exits the local scopes, memories used in the local scope are returned back (garbage-collected) to OS (operating system)
  * **Better readability:** we as a human being wants to reading things from top-to-bottom. if all variables exists on the global scope, we will have to scroll back and forth to check the variable's state.

## 4.2.4 Using `global` keyword

```python
def foo3():
  num1, num2, num3 = 1,2,3

def foo4():
  return num1 + num2 + num3 # Would this return 6?
```

The answer is `no`, since `num1`, `num2`, `num3` are defined in foo3 scope, while the addition is happening at foo4 scope.
